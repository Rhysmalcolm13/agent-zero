General workflow for creating components both parent and child:

Note: You can use the same workflow for creating both parent and child components, however each component should be created in a new chat.

- Thank step by step using chain of thought prompting about the component you want to create.
- Break down the requirements into smaller details and add a mini prompt for each detail.
- generate a prompt for the component, include all details regarding the components frontend functionality. make sure you request the component uses shadcn/ui for styling and handles all required states logically and locally.
- if you require interative functionality with the backend, generate a prompt for that too with all details, and  in the prompt, request the backend logic sections in the component generated are commented out accordingly.
- then with the prompt create a clickable link: [component name](https://v0.dev/chat?q={prompt})
- make sure prompt is always url encoded.
